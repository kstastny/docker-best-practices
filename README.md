##  1. <a name='Installation'></a>Installation

Since Docker for Desktop comes with many issues (licensing being one of them, stability another), I prefer running Docker in WSL.

###  1.1. <a name='SetupWSLdistribution'></a>Setup WSL distribution
To install WSL, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

1. Install Ubuntu

```bash
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

1. After installation, login to the new distribution and choose username and password. The prompt should open automatically.
1. Update and upgrade packages

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```


###  1.2. <a name='InstallDocker'></a>Install Docker

1. Install pre-requisities

  ```bash
  sudo apt install --no-install-recommends apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg2`
  ```

1. Trust the docker repo with packages
    1. set temporary OS-specific variables
        ```bash        
          source /etc/os-release
        ```

    1. Trust the repo        
        ```bash
        curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/${ID}/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
        ```

    1. Add and update the repo information
      ```bash        
          echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/${ID} ${VERSION_CODENAME} stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
      ```    
      ```bash        
          sudo apt update
      ```

1. Install Docker itself
      ```bash        
      sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose
      ```

Now, you should configure the user permissions and setup docker daemon to autorun but since I tend to launch docker daemon manually, I will skip this step and just point you to [https://dev.to/bowmanjd/install-docker-on-windows-wsl-without-docker-desktop-34m9](Jonathan Bowman's tutorial)


To verify the installation

1. run docker deamon `sudo dockerd`
1. run hello world container `docker run --rm hello-world`

This will print "Hello from Docker" and some informational messages if the installation is correct.

##  2. <a name='HowtoChangeLocationofVirtualHardDrives'></a>How to Change Location of Virtual Hard Drives

I have a small system disk, therefore I prefer moving the VHDs to a different harddrive to save space on the system.

1. Shutdown the WSL image. Let's assume that its name is "Ubuntu"
    ```bash 
    wsl --shutdown
    ```

1. Export the image data
    ```bash 
    wsl --export Ubuntu "D:\DockerDesktop-vm-data\Ubuntu.tar"
    ```

1. Unregister the image. Note that the ext4.vhdx will be removed automatically.
    ```bash 
    wsl --unregister Ubuntu
    ```

1. Import the WSL image to different directory.
    ```bash 
    wsl --import Ubuntu "D:\DockerDesktop-vm-data\wsl" "D:\DockerDesktop-vm-data\Ubuntu.tar" --version 2
    ```

1. Run the WSL distribution and verify. You may now remove the `Ubuntu.tar` file

###  3.1. <a name='Bashintocontainer'></a>Bash into container
```bash 
docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID bash
```


##  4. <a name='Multistagebuild'></a>Multistage build

Multistage builds are useful for building image files that only contain the application and not any residual files used during the build. Usually the usage is such that in the first stage (docker container) the application is built, then the second stage just copies the built files and the first container is dropped.

For example, we can setup multistage build like below (example taken from https://github.com/kstastny/alexandria repo)

```docker
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 as build

# Install node
RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs
RUN npm install yarn --global

RUN yarn --version

WORKDIR /workspace
COPY . .
RUN dotnet tool restore

RUN dotnet fake build -t Publish


FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0-alpine
COPY --from=build /workspace/publish/app /app
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 8085
ENTRYPOINT [ "dotnet", "Alexandria.Server.dll" ]
```

In the first stage, `build`, the application is built in .net SDK image.
The second stage takes the output from the build stage and creates a container that only contains the built application.

This approach has several advantages
* Resulting docker image is smaller because it does not contain SDK and other dependencies needed for build
* no source code is left on the image
* the build is reproducible on every machine running docker. There is no need for special setup of the build server

##  5. <a name='DockerCompose'></a>Docker Compose

Applications usually don't run in isolation but have to communicate with other services, be it a database, message queue or other applications.

It would be very unwieldy to run everything in one container, therefore we have to separate the services into one container per service. This gives us several advantages

* services can be developed, updated and versioned separately
* we have flexibility during deployment (e.g. we can use container database for local development and managed service for production deployment)
* services can be scaled separately

We could create the containers manually and connect them using [docker network](https://docs.docker.com/network) but that would be unwieldy and error prone. That is where [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) comes in. It allows us to define an application "stack" in one YAML file and start all the services in said stack using a single command.

###  5.1. <a name='DockerComposeforInfrastructure'></a>Docker Compose for Infrastructure

An example `docker-compose.yaml` file looks for https://github.com/kstastny/alexandria development looks like this.

```yaml
# format version https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/
version: '3.8'

# define list of services (containers) that compose our application
services:

  #identifier of database service  
  db:
    #Specify what image and version we should use; we use 10.5 due to https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26105
    image: mariadb:10.5
    #container restart policy https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/start-containers-automatically/
    restart: always
    #setup environment variables
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: mariadbexamplepassword
    #define port forwarding (host:container)
    ports:
      - 3306:3306
    #bind volume `alexandria-db` to directory `/var/lib/mysql`
    volumes:
      - alexandria-db:/var/lib/mysql

  adminer:
    image: adminer
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8090:8080


```

This file defines the infrastructure necessary for running [Alexandria](https://github.com/kstastny/alexandria) locally. I can now easily run the infrastructure and develop against it.

To run the infrastructure, execute

```bash 
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This will compose the whole infrastructure stack and run it in the background. 

###  5.2. <a name='DockerComposeforApplication'></a>Docker Compose for Application

If we want to run the whole application stack in one compose, for purpose of easy testing, we can just add the following service to define our docker-compose.yml.

```yaml
  alexandria:
    build:
      # build context. Either local directory or url to git repository
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    #https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/
    depends_on:
      - "db"
    command: ["./wait-for-it.sh", "db:3306", "--", "python", "app.py"]
    ports:
      - 8080:5000
    environment:
      DB__CONNECTIONSTRING: Server=db;Port=3306;Database=alexandria;Uid=root;Pwd=${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD};SslMode=none
      ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT: ${ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT}
```

This time we have used environment variable inject the database password (just for demonstration purposes).
For local run, we can store this variable in and .env file

```
MYSQL_PASSWORD=mariadbexamplepassword
```

and run the whole stack like this:
```bash 
docker-compose --env-file .env up --build -d
```

After everything is built, we can check the application logs using `docker-compose logs` command:
```bash 
docker-compose logs -ft alexandria
```


Note that using environment variables is not ideal for passing sensitive data. Better way would be to use Docker secrets (example coming later :))


We can of course have both the file with infrastructure and application defined and choose which one to run on our leisure
```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env up --file docker-compose.infrastructure.yml --build -d`
```


###  5.3. <a name='Combiningdockercomposefiles'></a>Combining docker compose files

It is also possible to combine multiple docker-compose files and run them with one command. The files specified later override values of files preceding them. 
Continuing the example above, we can specify the yaml in two separate files
* `docker-compose.infrastructure.yml`
* `docker-compose.app.yml`

and run the whole stack with one command:

```bash 
docker-compose -f docker-compose.infrastructure.yml -f docker-compose.app.yml --env-file .env up --build -d
```


###  5.4. <a name='Sources-1'></a>Sources

* https://docs.docker.com/compose/


##  6. <a name='Persistingdata'></a>Persisting data

Data can be persisted between container restarts using either *volumes* or *bind mounts*.

1. **Volumes** are created and managed by Docker
1. **Bind Mounts** are directories or files mounted to docker container from host system

###  6.1. <a name='Volumes'></a>Volumes

Volumes are preferred way for persisting data. They are fully managed by Docker and no external process should touch the filesystem path where the volumes are created. Once created, the volumes are kept on disk so the data is kept even between container runs.

* data can be shared between containers, even two containers running at the same time can access the same volume
* are managed by docker so the Docker container controls the directory and file structure
* easy backup (either `/var/lib/docker/volumes/<volume-name>` or see below)


Create a volume
```bash
docker volume create alexandria-db
```

To start a container with volume, use flag `-v` with parameters name of volume and path where it will mount:
```bash
docker run -dp 3306:3306 --name dbtest -v alexandria-db:/var/lib/mysql -e "MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=test" mariadb:10.5
```


####  6.1.1. <a name='Volumesanddocker-compose'></a>Volumes and docker-compose

* Volumes specified in `docker-compose.yml` are created automatically
* Even anonymous volumes are picked up by docker compose

Volume may also be created outside of docker compose using `docker volume create` and then referenced in `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
#define volumes necessary
volumes:
  #named volume will be created automatically if it does not exist. Otherwise it is mounted
  alexandria-db:
    external: true
```  

If the `external` flag is set to true,then docker-compose up does not attempt to create it, and raises an error if it doesn’t exist.


####  6.1.2. <a name='Backupvolumedata'></a>Back up volume data

Example - backup and restore `etc/todos` from volume in container `eloquent_tereshkova` to c:/temp/bak.
Then restore the directory to containervolume `todo2`:

Run container, mount volumes from said container, bind mount host directory and tar directory `/etc/todos`:
```bash
docker run --rm --volumes-from eloquent_tereshkova -v c/temp/bak:/backup ubuntu tar cvf /backup/backup.tar /etc/todos
```

Untar the backed data into new container:
```bash
docker run --rm --volumes-from todo2 -v c/temp/bak:/backup ubuntu bash -c "cd / && tar xvf /backup/backup.tar --strip 0"
```


###  6.2. <a name='Bindmounts'></a>Bind mounts

Bind Mount specifies file or directory from host computer that is mounted into the running container. This means that the Docker process has no such control and in general this way is slower (see https://docs.docker.com/storage/#good-use-cases-for-volumes for reasons).
There are still good use case for Bind mounts:

* sharing configuration
* sharing source code during development - you may mount your source code into a Docker container where the build happens while at the same time using your IDE to edit the code


use `-v` flag to bind mount existing directory to container:

For example:
```bash
docker run -d -it -name devtest -v "$(pwd)":/app nginx:latest
```


###  6.3. <a name='Sources-1'></a>Sources

* https://docs.docker.com/storage/
* https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#backup-restore-or-migrate-data-volumes
* https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volume-configuration-reference


##  7. <a name='Dockernetwork'></a>Docker network

While the containers are independent, sometimes they need to be able to talk to each other. The answer to that need is `docker network`. For two containers to talk to each other, they have to be on the same network.

To create the network
> docker network create alexandria_default


To run a container at specified network, use the `--network` flag. The `--network-alias` specifies how the container is identified in the network so we can find it.

> docker run -dp 3306:3306 --network alexandria_default --network-alias db --name dbtest -v alexandria-db:/var/lib/mysql -e "MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=test" mariadb:10.5


For development purposes, I don't usually define the networks manually. When using `docker-compose`, the network is created automatically and that is enough for most cases.


##  8. <a name='Pushimageintoregistry'></a>Push image into registry

Login to docker hub

```bash
docker login -u kstastny
```

Tag the image locally

```bash
docker tag alexandria_alexandria kstastny/alexandria:latest
```

push to registry
```bash
docker push kstastny/alexandria:latest
```
